# Compiling

# Usage

Step 1: launch the program and click "Open mesh" to select a mesh in .obj format;
Step 2: click "Tet-meshing" to tetrahedralize the input surface mesh for Hex-dominant meshing;
Step 3: click "Build-Structure" to construct the hierarchical structure;
Step 4: click "Rosy" to optimize the orientation field;
Step 5: click "Posy" to optimize the position field;
Step 6: click "Extract" to obtain the hybrid mesh.
